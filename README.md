# Simple tcp
Show how a connection is made between a Client and a Server ysing Sockets in Java
with a predefined message sent and received

# Simple tcp 2
A number guessing game using Java Sockets, where the Client has to guess a secret number between 1 and 10 generated by the Server

# Simple tcp 3
Same as the first simple_tcp package 
The only deference is that i changed the 'localhost' in the Client.java class with the actual IP of the the host to test TCP transmitted packages using wireShark
